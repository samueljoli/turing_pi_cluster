## Installing Alpine on RPI 4
Raspberry Pi's have a special boot procedure that uses a FAT partition [^1] and the GPU.


[^1]: A FAT (File Allocation Table) partition is a type of file system used for storing data on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and SD cards.
The FAT file system is one of the oldest and most widely compatible file systems, making it a common choice for boot partitions and removable storage.
There are several versions of FAT, with FAT32 being the most common for larger storage devices due to its support for larger file sizes and partitions compared to its predecessors, FAT12 and FAT16.
